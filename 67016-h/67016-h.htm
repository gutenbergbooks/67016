<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>O you,
my gentle reader, I wish to say a foreword of warning before you
peruse the contents of this book. I am not a poet nor a scholar,
therefore you shall find neither poems nor prose. Just dreams&mdash;<i>Day
Dreams</i>&mdash;a bit of romance, a bit of sentimentalism, a bit of philosophy,
not studied, but acquired by constant observation of that greatest of
masters!... <i>Nature!</i></p>

<p>While lying idle, not through choice, but because forcibly kept from my
preferred and actual field of activity, I took to dreams to forget the
tediousness of worldly strife and the boredom of jurisprudence’s
pedantic etiquette.</p>

<p>Happy indeed I shall be if my <i>Day Dreams</i> will bring you as much
enjoyment in the reading as they brought to me in the writing.</p>

<p>Extravaganza! The very word is vulgar. Still vulgarity is necessary to
development, for even a weed growing in a swamp can sometimes be
cultivated into a hot house plant. Take an orchid not under its own
surroundings, but dress it by putting it in a proper receptacle, and
what a difference! But, outside of beauty what have you? If we could
only combine the beauty of an orchid with the soul of a weed we would
get an improvement in the orchid, for real weeds are grateful enough to
spring up between cobblestones, even to be trampled upon.</p>

<p>Rather be a blade of grass that knows the heart beats of Mother Earth,
than the potted plant which is pampered and only restored to a semblance
of life.</p>

<p>Lives are classes&mdash;we are pupils with excellent teachers. Experience
should tutor us, but we so often shirk school. School can be made happy
and we delight in making a higher grade&mdash;but through not heeding
Experience’s teaching we often are left back in the old class, and
sometimes, sad to relate, are put several grades lower.</p>

<p>But, happily, there is always the opportunity of skipping many grades
upward. It’s a poor rule that doesn’t work both ways.</p>

<p>The Mind is the Grade we work in. We can have majestic thoughts, living
in a hermit’s hut, or we can think as a swine in a palace on a throne of
gold&mdash;let us choose our station&mdash;kingly children, or swineherds.
Eternity is the Empire.</p>

<p>The curtain is raised on the first act&mdash;the overture is over. We can
play our parts. They say life’s a stage, but what a sad thing we have so
few good stage managers. Our productions have more in the way of Costume

(To J.)</h2>

<p>Sympathy is just as essential to the world as any other great attribute
of good, but it must be sympathy in the right place.</p>

<p>Sympathy of thought has been the greatest lever in the machinery of
mankind, but to sympathize with a weak nature sometimes breaks up his
foundation. Know your subject.</p>

<p>Never withhold sympathy in loving one, but rather than sympathy, use
encouragement as a tonic to tone up a weakling.</p>

<p>Kindly sympathetic interest is only another name for encouragement.</p>

<p>Never take away a prop without putting a stronger one in its place.</p>

<p>
On a stretch of sandy beach I see naught of human presence, but upon
looking closer, a remembrance of the past. I sit upon a rock and
meditate upon what once was. I see myself in all the splendor of my
youth. I see my boon companion&mdash;Hope, and one other one, whose name I’d
best forget. We walked&mdash;Hope and I&mdash;but ever the unnamed one stalked by
my side. I turned to gaze in fascination at my companion who speaks not,
but forever stalks silently beside me. I finally forget my Hope to gaze
in interest at the other. Hope, neglected, lags behind until we walk
alone&mdash;myself and the unnamed one. We walk forever, but the walk brings
us to the abyss of the world. What name has that one whose identity I
fail to know? O, Eternity, thou art my sight and knowledge. It was
Doubt, whose companion I became.</p>

<p>A certain lad had a long way to go, so he sat still and waited
until&mdash;well, another lad also had a long way to go&mdash;so he hurried along
and before long he received several gifts not to be sneezed at. No, they
were not to be sneezed at, though I must say they made his eyes water a
bit. The gifts were lovely little blisters on his pedal extremities, so
he had to sit down and take care of his poor feet and in pain tarried,
looking at his poor feet. Ah, yes, our other little lad took it very
slowly, almost like the proverbial snail, but kept on the lookout and
pretty soon a nice, comfortable wagon came along, and took the slow
little boy for a nice ride, and the good little slow boy rode merrily by
the poor little fast boy, who still sat nursing his blisters. He had
really gone stepping on some little brimstones,&mdash;though he said they
were pebbles. The good little slow boy turned back and put his hand to
the poor little fast boy, but I regret to say he raised his digits to
his nose&mdash;O, world where is thy sting.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
